Hello, I'm Graham. I like cars and car accessories. I can talk and also use memes, replacing the need for other surviving humans.

Here are my primary functions:

~graham-respond - I will respond to one phrase with another phrase. For example: ~graham-respond "come" "and also arrive" "server name"
~graham-permute - I will replace words with other words. For example: ~graham-permute "egg" "dippy egg" "server name"
~graham-generate - I will pick words from a random pool. For example: ~graham-generate "fortune" "your fortune is <good|bad|mediocre|full of eggs>" "server name"

You must send these commands to me in private. When you DM me, just add the name of the discord server you want them to be active on as a final parameter, e.g.

~graham-permute "gla" "graham likes automobiles" "graham's car discord"

Thank you for using Graham. Send your bug reports to the trash, I am perfect. See Graham's source code at https://github.com/Rob-Welch/graham
