Hello, I'm Graham. I like cars and car accessories. I can talk and also use memes, replacing the need for other surviving humans.

By default, I do literally nothing. However, you can program me via DM to make bad conversation.

For example, if we're in a server called "graham's car discord", and you DM me the following:

~graham-respond "pinion" "buy that for graham's car" "graham's car discord"

Then, any time someone says the word 'pinion', I will respond with 'buy that for graham's car'. Of course, I have many other functions, which are listed at the bottom of this help message.

Thank you for using Graham. Send your bug reports to the trash, I am perfect. See Graham's source code at https://github.com/Rob-Welch/graham
